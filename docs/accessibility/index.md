Accessibility for web is a crucial aspect of designing and developing websites that are user-friendly, inclusive and compliant with standards. Accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate and interact with web content and services without barriers or difficulties. Some examples of barriers are: images without alternative text, videos without captions, forms without labels, complex layouts without headings, low contrast colors, keyboard traps, etc. Accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, such as older people, people with low bandwidth or slow devices, people with temporary impairments or situational limitations. Accessibility for web is not only a moral obligation, but also a legal requirement in many countries and regions. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of recommendations developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that provide principles, guidelines and success criteria for making web content accessible to everyone. By following the WCAG, web developers can ensure that their websites meet the needs and preferences of a diverse range of users.

Hi there! Welcome to my blog where I share my passion for web accessibility. In this post, I will explain what web accessibility is, why it is important, and how you can make your websites more accessible by following some simple tips and best practices. Web accessibility is not only good for people with disabilities, but also for everyone who uses the web. Let's dive in!

What is Web Accessibility?

Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can:

- perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web
- contribute to the Web

Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including:

- auditory
- cognitive
- neurological
- physical
- speech
- visual

Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:

- people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc.
- older people with changing abilities due to ageing
- people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses
- people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio
- people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth

Why is Web Accessibility Important?

Web accessibility is important for individuals, businesses, and society.

For individuals, web accessibility can:

- enable equal access and opportunity
- enhance participation and inclusion
- improve user experience and satisfaction
- reduce frustration and confusion

For businesses, web accessibility can:

- increase customer base and loyalty
- improve brand reputation and social responsibility
- reduce legal risks and compliance costs
- enhance innovation and creativity

For society, web accessibility can:

- promote human rights and dignity
- support social justice and diversity
- foster digital inclusion and empowerment
- advance sustainable development goals

How to Make Your Websites More Accessible?

There are many ways to make your websites more accessible. One of the most widely used and recognized standards for web accessibility is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

The WCAG are developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is an international organization that develops web standards. The WCAG provide principles, guidelines and success criteria for making web content accessible to everyone.

The WCAG are organized around four principles that state that web content must be:

- Perceivable: Users must be able to perceive the information presented on the web page.
- Operable: Users must be able to operate the interface elements on the web page.
- Understandable: Users must be able to understand the information and operation of the web page.
- Robust: Users must be able to access the web page using a variety of tools and technologies.

Each principle has several guidelines that provide specific goals for web developers to achieve. Each guideline has several success criteria that provide measurable outcomes for web developers to test.

The WCAG have three levels of conformance: A (lowest), AA (medium), and AAA (highest). Each level includes all the success criteria from the previous level(s). Most policies and regulations require at least level AA conformance.

To help you meet the WCAG requirements, there are many resources available online. One of them is How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference), which provides a customizable checklist of the WCAG success criteria, along with techniques and examples for implementing them.

Another resource is WebAIM, which is a non-profit organization that provides web accessibility information, tools, and services. One of their tools is WAVE, which is a web accessibility evaluation tool that can help you identify and fix accessibility issues on your web pages.

There are also many other tools, tutorials, courses, blogs, podcasts, and communities that can help you learn more about web accessibility and how to apply it to your websites. I will share some of them in my future posts, so stay tuned!
