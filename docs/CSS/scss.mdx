## SCSS Nesting

SCSS nesting allows you to nest CSS rules within one another, providing a more organized and readable structure to your stylesheets. It follows a similar indentation pattern as most programming languages. With nesting, you can define the styles for child elements within their parent elements.

Example:

```scss
.container {
  background-color: #f1f1f1;

  h1 {
    color: #333;
    font-size: 24px;
  }

  p {
    color: #666;
    font-size: 16px;
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `.container` class acts as the parent selector, and the `h1` and `p` elements are nested within it. The resulting CSS output will have the appropriate hierarchical structure.

## Parent Selector (`&`)

The ampersand (`&`) is a special character in SCSS that represents the parent selector. It allows you to reference the parent selector within nested rules and modify it dynamically. It's particularly useful when you want to generate more specific selectors based on the parent selector.

Example:

```scss
.button {
  background-color: blue;

  &:hover {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }

  &.active {
    background-color: red;
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `&:hover` rule will be compiled to `.button:hover`, and the `&.active` rule will be compiled to `.button.active`. The parent selector (`&`) is used to generate more specific selectors without explicitly repeating the parent class name.

## Placeholder Selector (`%`)

The placeholder selector in SCSS allows you to define reusable styles that can be extended by other selectors. It is denoted by the percent sign (`%`). Placeholder selectors are not directly compiled into CSS but can be extended using the `@extend` directive.

Example:

```scss
%button {
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  padding: 10px;
}

.primary-button {
  @extend %button;
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
}

.secondary-button {
  @extend %button;
  background-color: gray;
  color: black;
}
```

In the above example, `%button` is a placeholder selector that defines common styles for buttons. The `.primary-button` and `.secondary-button` classes extend the `%button` styles using the `@extend` directive. This way, the styles defined in `%button` are inherited by both classes.

When the SCSS code is compiled to CSS, the placeholder selector `%button` will not generate any CSS output. Instead, the styles defined in `%button` will be applied to the selectors that extend it (`primary-button` and `secondary-button`).

These features in SCSS, namely nesting, parent selector (`&`), and placeholder selector (`%`), can greatly enhance the maintainability and reusability of your stylesheets by providing a more organized structure and flexibility in styling.

## Variables

- Variables in SCSS allow you to store values and reuse them throughout your stylesheets.
- Declare variables using the `$` symbol followed by the variable name and assign a value to them.
- Variables make it easier to update styles consistently by defining a value once and referencing it multiple times.
- Changes to variable values automatically propagate to all the places where the variable is used.
- Use variables for colors, font sizes, spacing, breakpoints, and other reusable values.

Example:

```scss
$primary-color: #ff0000;
$font-size: 16px;

.container {
  background-color: $primary-color;
}

.title {
  font-size: $font-size;
}
```

In the above example, `$primary-color` and `$font-size` are variables that store the values for the primary color and font size, respectively. These variables are then used within the `.container` and `.title` selectors, allowing you to centralize and reuse the values.

By using variables, if you decide to change the primary color or font size, you only need to modify the variable declaration, and the changes will automatically apply to all the places where the variable is referenced.

### Scope

- SCSS follows block scoping, which means variables are accessible within the scope in which they are defined.
- Variables declared outside any selector have a global scope and can be accessed throughout the SCSS file.
- Variables declared within a selector or a block have a local scope and are only accessible within that scope and its nested scopes.
- Nested selectors can access variables defined in their parent selectors.
- Avoid naming conflicts by using different variable names in different scopes.

Example:

```scss
$primary-color: #ff0000;

.container {
  $background-color: #f1f1f1;

  .title {
    color: $primary-color;
    background-color: $background-color;
  }
}

// Variable outside the scope
$font-size: 16px;

.text {
  font-size: $font-size;
}
```

In the above example, `$primary-color` is declared outside any selector, making it a global variable accessible throughout the SCSS file. On the other hand, `$background-color` is declared within the `.container` selector, making it accessible only within that selector and its nested selectors.

The `.title` selector can access both `$primary-color` and `$background-color` because it is nested within the `.container` selector. However, the `.text` selector, which is outside the `.container` selector, can only access the global variable `$font-size`.

Understanding scope is important to ensure that variables are declared in the appropriate places and that their values are accessible where needed.

### Best Practices

- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables to enhance code readability.
- Group related variables together and use comments to provide context.
- Declare variables at the top of the file or within the relevant selector to make them easily discoverable.
- Prefer variables over hard-coded values to improve code maintainability.
- Regularly review and refactor your variables to ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary redundancy.

By leveraging variables and understanding scope in SCSS, you can create more modular, reusable, and maintainable stylesheets. They provide flexibility and enable efficient updates and modifications to your styles.

## Variables types

In SCSS, variables can store different types of values, including numbers, strings, colors, lists, and maps. Let's go through each type in detail:

### Number

A number variable in SCSS represents numerical values such as integers or decimal numbers. These variables can be used in calculations, operations, and measurements.

Example:

```scss
$font-size: 16px;
$line-height: 1.5;
$padding: 10px;
```

In the above example, `$font-size`, `$line-height`, and `$padding` are number variables that store different numerical values.

### String

String variables in SCSS store sequences of characters, such as text or strings of characters. String variables are typically used for things like font names, class names, or any text-based values.

Example:

```scss
$font-family: "Arial";
$prefix: "btn-";
```

In the above example, `$font-family` and `$prefix` are string variables that store font family names and CSS class name prefixes, respectively.

### Color

Color variables in SCSS store color values, including named colors, hexadecimal values, RGB values, or HSL values. These variables are widely used to define and reuse colors throughout stylesheets.

Example:

```scss
$primary-color: #ff0000;
$background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
```

In the above example, `$primary-color` and `$background-color` are color variables that store different color values.

### List

List variables in SCSS store ordered collections of values. Lists can contain values of different types, such as numbers, strings, or other lists. They are useful for defining sets of related values.

Example:

```scss
$colors: #ff0000, #00ff00, #0000ff;
$font-sizes: 12px, 16px, 20px;
```

In the above example, `$colors` and `$font-sizes` are list variables that store collections of color values and font sizes, respectively.

5. Map:
   Map variables in SCSS store key-value pairs. Each value in a map is associated with a specific key. They are useful for storing and accessing related data in a structured manner.

Example:

```scss
$breakpoints: (
  small: 480px,
  medium: 768px,
  large: 1024px,
);
```

In the above example, `$breakpoints` is a map variable that stores different screen breakpoints with corresponding key-value pairs.

By using these different types of variables in SCSS, you can store and manipulate various kinds of values, allowing for more flexibility and modularity in your stylesheets.
